###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function a(x){
  x++;
  return function(){
  console.log(++x)
  }
}

a(1)();
a(1)();
a(1)();

let x = a(1);
x();
x();
x();
```

- A: `1, 2, 3` and `1, 2, 3`
- B: `3, 3, 3` and `3, 4, 5`
- C: `3, 3, 3` and `1, 2, 3`
- D: `1, 2, 3` and `3, 3, 3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

This question reminds us about Closure in JS. Closure allows us to create a `stateful function` and such function can access to variable outside of its scope. In a nutshell, a closure can have access to `global` variable (scope), `father function` scope and `its` own scope.

We have here 3, 3, 3 and 3, 4, 5 because first we simply call the function `a()`. It works like a normal function and we do not see something `stateful` here. In later case, we declare a variable `x` and it stores the value of function `a(1)`, that is why we get 3. 4. 5 rather than 3, 3, 3.

This kind of gotcha gives me the feeling of `static` variable in PHP world.

###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
function Name(a, b){
  this.a = a;
  this.b = b;
}

const me = Name("Vuong", "Nguyen);

console.log(!(a.length - window.a.length));
```

- A: `undefined`
- B: `NaN`
- C: `true`
- D: `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

We get true in the console. The tricky part is when we create an object from the constructor function Name but we DO NOT USE `new` keywork. That makes the variable `a` global one and get the value "Vuong". Remember that it is actually a property of the global object `window` (in the browser) or `global` in the nodejs. 

We then get `a.length` ~ 5 and `window.a.length` ~ 5 which return 0. !0 returns true.

Imagine what would happen when we create the instance `me` with the `new` keywork. That is an interesting inquire!

###### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
const x = function (...x){
  let k = (typeof x).length;
  let y = ()=> "freetut".length;
  let z = {y:y};
  return k - z.y();
  
};

console.log(Boolean(x()))
```

- A: `true`
- B:  1
- C: -1
- D: `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The spread operator `...x` might help us obtain the parameter in the function in the form of array. Yet, in Javascript the typeof array return "object" rather than "array". It is totally odd if you are coming from PHP.

That is said, we now have the length of the string `object` which returns 6. z.y() simply returns the length of the string 'freetut' (7). 

Be aware that the function x() (in the form of `function express` or `anonymous function` (if you are coming from PHP) return -1 when being called and when converted to bool with `Boolean(-1)` return true instead of false. Noted that `Boolean(0)` return false.

###### 4. What's the output?

```javascript
(function js(x){
   
   const y = (j) => j*x;
   
   console.log(y(s()))
   
   function s(){
     return j();
   }
  
   function j(){
     return x**x;
   }
  
})(3);
```

- A: `undefined`
- B:  18
- C:  81
- D:  12

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C
The function `js()` can be automatically executed without calling it and known as IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). Noted the parameter `x` of the function `js` is actuallly passed with the value 3.

The value return of the function is y(s())), meaning calling three other functions `y()`, `s()` and `j()` because the function `s()` returns `j()`. 

j() returns 3^3 = 27 so that s() returns 27.

y(s()) means y(27) which returns 27*3 = 81.

Note that we can call `declare function` BEFORE the function is actually declared but not with `expression function`.

###### 5. What's the output?

```javascript

var tip = 100;

(function () {
    
  console.log("I have $" + husband());
  
  function wife(){
    return tip*2;
  }
  
  function husband(){
    return wife()/2;
  }
  
  var tip = 10;
  
})();
```

- A:  "I have $10";
- B:  "I have $100";
- C:  "I have $50";
- D:  "I have $NaN";

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D
We have here an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). It means we do not have to call it but it will be excuted automatically when declared. The flow is as: husband() returns wife()/2 and wife() returns tip*2. 

We might think that tip = 100 because it is a global variable when declaring with `var` keyword. However, it is actually `undefined` because we also have `var tip = 10` INSIDE the function. As the variable `tip` is hoisted with default value `undefined`, the final result would be D. We know that `undefined` returns NaN when we try to divide to 2 or multiple with 2.

If we do not re-declare `var tip = 10;` at the end of the function, we will definately get D.

JS is fun, right?

###### 6. What's the output?

```javascript

const js = { language: "loosely type", label: "difficult" };

const edu = {...js, level: "PhD"};

const newbie = edu;

delete edu.language;

console.log(Object.keys(newbie).length);
```

- A:  2;
- B:  3;
- C:  4;
- D:  5;

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This challenge revises the ES6's feature regarding `spread operator ...` Spread operator is quite useful for retrieving parameter in function, to `unite` or `combine` object and array in JavaScript. PHP also has this feature.

In the variable `edu`, we use `...js` (spread operator here) to combine both objects into one. It works in the same way with array.

Then we declare another variable named `newbie`. IMPORTANT note: By declaring the variable like that, both variables point to the SAME POSITION in the memory. We may have known something like `$a = &$b` in PHP, which let both varibles work in the same way. We might have known about `pass by reference` in the case.

Then we have 2 as `edu.language` is deleted. Both objects now have only two elements.

Now is time to think about coping an object in JS either shallow or deep one.

###### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
var candidate = {
	name : 'Vuong',
	age  : 30
}

var job = {
	frontend : 'Vuejs or Reactjs',
	backend : 'PHP and Laravel',
	city : 'Auckland'
} 

class Combine{
  static get(){
    return Object.assign(candidate, job)
  }
  
  static count(){    
    return Object.keys(this.get()).length;
  }
}

console.log(Combine.count());
```

- A:  5;
- B:  6;
- C:  7;
- D:  8;

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The buit-in method `Object.assign(candidate, job)` merges the two objects `candidate` and `job` into one object. Then the method `Object.keys` counts the number of `key` in the object.

Note that two methods `get()` and `count()` are defined as `static`, so they need to be called statically using `Class.staticmethod()` syntax. Then the final object get 5 elements.

###### 8. What's the output?

```javascript
var x = 1;

(()=> {x += 1; ++x})();
((y)=> {x +=y; x = x%y;})(2);
(()=> x += x)();
(()=> x *= x)();

console.log(x);
```

- A:  4;
- B:  50;
- C:  2;
- D:  10;

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Initially `x` is declared with the value 1. In the first IIFE function, there are two operations. First `x` becomes 2 and then 3.

In the second IIFE function, `x = x + y` then the current value is 5. In the second operation, it returns only 1 as it undergoes `5%2`.

In the third and fouth IIFE functions, we get 2 `x = x + x` and then 4 `x = x * x`. It is more than simple.

- C:  21 and 26;
- D:  26 and 21;

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

This question illustrates the diffences between PHP and JavaScript when handling closure. In the first snippet, we declare a closure with the keyword `use`. Closure in PHP is simply an anonymous function and the data is passed to the function using the keyword `use`. Otherwise, it is called as `lambda` when we do not use the keyword `use`. You can check the result of the snippet here https://3v4l.org/PSeMY. PHP `closure` only accepts the value of the variable BEFORE the closure is defined, no matter where it is called. As such, `$var` is 10 rather than 15.

On the contrary, JavaScript treats the variable a bit different when it is passed to anonymous function. We do not have to use the keyword `use` here to pass variable to the closure. The variable `x` in the second snippet is updated before the closure is called, then we get 26.

Note that in PHP 7.4, we have arrow function and we then do not have to use the keyword `use` to pass the variable to function. Another way to call a `global` ariable inside a function in PHP is to use the keyword `global` or employ the built-in GLOBAL variable $GLOBALS.

###### 10. What's the output?

```javascript
let x = {};
let y = {};
let z = x;

console.log(x == y);
console.log(x === y);
console.log(x == z);
console.log(x === z);
```

- A:  true    true    true    true;
- B:  false   false   false   false;
- C:  true    true    false   false;
- D:  false   false   true    true;

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Technically, `x` and `y` have the same value. Both are empty objects. However, we do not use the value to compare objects.

`z` is `x` are two objects referring to the same memory position. In JavaScript, array and object are passed by `reference`. `x` and `z` therefore return true when being compared.

###### 11. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log("hello");

setTimeout(()=>console.log("hey"), 1);
setTimeout(()=>console.log("kiora"), 2);
setTimeout(()=>console.log("world"), 0);

console.log("hi");
```

- A:  "hello" "hey" "kiora" "world" "hi"
- B:  "hello" "hi"  "hey"   "kiora" "world"
- C:  "hello" "hi"  "world" "hey"   "kiora"
- D:  "hello" "hi"  "hey"   "world" "kiora"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Given that three setTimeout() functions will be kept in the `task queue` before jumping back to `stack`, "hello" and "hi" will be printed first, then A is totally incorrect.

We might have the feeling that three setTimeout() functions should be executed in the order "world" -> "hey" -> "kiora" providing that the time we have set are 0 mil second -> 1 mil second -> 2 mil second respectively. Yet, there is no different between 0 and 1 mil second. That is why we will see "hey" in the next. "world" is being executed then and following by the last on "kiora".

###### 12. What's the output?

```javascript

String.prototype.lengthy = ()=>{
  
    console.log("hello");
  
 };

let x = {name: "Vuong"}

delete x;

x.name.lengthy();

```
- A:  "Vuong";
- B:  "hello";
- C:  "undefined"
- D:  "ReferenceError"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`String.prototype.something = function(){}` is the common way to define a new built-in method for `String`. We can do the same thing with `Array`, `Object` or `FunctionName` where FunctionName is the function designed by ourself.

That is not challenging to realise that `"string".length()` always returns `hello`. Yet, the tricky part lies in the `delete object` where we might think that this expression will entirely delete the object. That is not the case as `delete` is used to delete the property of the object only. It does not delete the object. Then we get `hello` rather than `ReferenceError`.

Note that if we declare object without `let, const` or `var`, we then have a global object. `delete objectName` then return `true`. Otherwise, it always returns `false`.

###### 13. What's the output?

```javascript

let x = {};

x.__proto__.hi = 10;

Object.prototype.hi = ++x.hi;

console.log(x.hi + Object.keys(x).length);

```
- A:  10
- B:  11
- C:  12
- D:  NaN

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First we have an empty object `x`, then we add another property `hi` for x with `x.__proto__.hi`. Note this is equivalent to `Object.prototype.hi = 10` and we are adding to the `father` object `Object` the property `hi`. It means every single object will inherit this propety. The property `hi` becomes a shared one. Say now we declare a new object such as `let y = {}`, `y` now has a propery `hi` inherited from the `father` `Object`. Put it simply `x.__proto__ === Object.prototype` returns `true`.

Then we overwrite the property `hi` with a new value 11. Last we have 11 + 1 = 12. `x` has one property and `x.hi` returns 11.

- C:  434
- D:  343

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

This question examines how the `delete` operator works in JavaScript. In short, it does nothing when we write `delete someObject` or `delete someArray`. It nonetheless completely deletes and removes a property of an object when writing something like `delete someObject.someProperty`. In the case of array, when we write `delete someArray[keyNumber]`, it only removes the `value` of the `index`, keep the `index` intact and the new `value` is now set to `undefined`. For that reason, in the code first snippet, we get (the length) 4 elements as in the original array but only 3 properties left in the object passed when the function object() is called, as in the second snippet.

The third snippet gives us 4 as declaring an object's propery to either `null` or `undefined` does not completely remove the property. The key is intact. So the length of the object is immutable.

For those who are familiar with PHP, we have `unset($someArray[index])` that remove the array element, both key and value. When `print_r` the array, we might not see the key and value that have been unset. However, when we push (using `array_push($someArray, $someValue)`) a new element in that array, we might see that the previous key is still kept, but no value and not being displayed. That is something you should be aware of. Have a look at https://3v4l.org/7C3Nf

```
- A:  true  true  true
- B:  false false true
- C:  true  true  false
- D:  false true  false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`a` and `b` returns false because they point to different memory location even though the values are the same. If you are coming from PHP world, then it will return true obviously when we compare either value or value + type. Check it out: https://3v4l.org/IjaOs.

In JavaScript, value is passed by reference in case of `array` and `object`. Hence in the second case, `d` is the copy of `c` but they both point to the same memory position. Everything changes in `c` will result in the change in `d`. In PHP, we might have `$a = &$b;`, working in the similar way.

The third one gives us a hint to copy an array in JavaScript using `slice()` method. Now we have `f`, which is the copy of `e` but they point to different memory locations, thus they have different "life". We get `false` accordingly when they are being compared.

```

- A:  8
- B:  NaN
- C:  64
- D:  12

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 64

The code snippet is quite tricky as it has a couple of different built-in methods handling object in `JavaScript`. For example, both `Object.keys` and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` are used even thought they are quite similar except that the latter can return non-enumerable properties. You might want to have a look at this thoroughly written reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames


`Object.values` and `Object.keys` return the property value and property name of the object, respectively. That is nothing new. `object.hasOwnProperty('propertyName')` returns a `boolean` confirming whether a property exists or not. 

We have `flag` true because `Object.values(languages)[0][4].name` returns `feature`, which is also the name of the property. 

Then we have 4 << 4 in the `if-else` flow that returns the bitwise value, equivalent to `4*2^4` ~ `4*16` ~ 64.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

We can use `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()` to appy a function to any object. At first sight, it seems that three functions do the same thing. Yet there are some situations where they are differently employed to handle respective contexts or solve particular problems. 

Of the three, only `bind()` can be executed after binding. We can create a variable to store the result as `helloRonaldo()` in the code snippet above. `apply()` and `call()` will bind and execute the function at the same time. `apply()` hints us `a` ~ array where we need to pass an array as parameter. `call()` hints us `c` or comma where we pass parameters with a comma. You might want to have a look at this post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15455009/javascript-call-apply-vs-bind

Note that `window.window.window.score` or `window.score` or simply `score` do the same thing. It points to the `score()` function in the global scope.

The correct anwser is D. The `score()` and `getAge()` functions are nothing special.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`bind()` allows us to bind a function declared with any object. Here we bind `score()` and both `ronaldo` and `messi`. 

In `score()` we pass three parameters `year`, `tr` and `t` in which both `tr` and `t` are function. They handle simple things as defined afterwards.

When we bind `score()` with `ronaldo` and `messi`, we pass three parameters as declared in the `score()` function wherein `transform` and `title` are functions.

#### Answer: D
`Object.keys(obj)` is almost identical to `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)` except the fact that the latter returns any type of object's property regardless of `enumerable`. By default `enumerable` is true when creating object. Using Object.defineProperties or Object.defineProperty we can manually set this option to `false`.

As such the object `person` will get 3 using`Object.keys(obj)`but 4 with `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`. `In short Object.keys(obj)` only returns the property setting the enumerable as `true`.

#### Answer: D

When declaring a function inside another function, we are working with Closure in JavaScript. Note that if a function is declared as normal (rather than function expression), it is hoisted. We might see several `id` in the code snippet above but in fact, some of them does nothing. 

The result of the code depending on the operator `typeof id`, which is `function`. So `id` in this operation is the `id()` function.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`Object.create` allows us to create an object which is based on another object. If we do not pass the second parameter - `book2` in this case - the `name` property of the object `bookCollection` will be `Name of the rose` inherited from the `book1`. It means we can provide additional properties when declaring object with `Object.create`.

`bookCollection` has its own property `name` and another one inherited from `book1`. In this case its own property `name` will show up as it has higher priority. That is why we get 'Harry Potter'.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The two objects `a` and `b` are created using `Object.create()` operator. There is a bit of difference between them as `a` inherits from Object prototype but `b` is totally empty when we pass the `null` paramater. Yet `hasOwnProperty('toString')` always returns `false` neither `a` nor `b` given that `toString()` is not defined inside these objects. The method however is still available as it is inherited from Object prototype. 

Both `f1` and `f2` return `false`. Note that we use `object.hasOwnProperty('key')` and `('key' in object)` to check the availability of a key in an object. There is a bit difference between the two as the latter also returns the key inherited. You might want to have a look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455338/how-do-i-check-if-an-object-has-a-key-in-javascript

Then `typeof a.toString()` returns `string`, which gives us 6 with the `.length` property.

If the syntax is odd to you, you might look for 'self-invoking function' and 'arrow function' in JavaScript.

- D:  16,   256,  3,    2

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B
We first declare a promise-based code with `let` and then call it. Given that `setTimeout()` is an asynchronous action, it will run last even the time is set to 0 in `setTimeout(() => rs(4), 0);`. Although `Promise.resolve(console.log(3))` also returns a promise but it is a Microtasks, then it has a higher priority than Tasks as set by `setTimeout()`. You might want to have a look at this post https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/.

In `.then()` we chain the result so that we have `4^4` in the first then() and `4*4` in the second `then()`. Note that `return rs` returns the original value.

```
- A:  ReferenceError
- B:  done, hello, world
- C:  hello, done, world
- D:  kiora, done, hello, world

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Though we do not declare any paramater for the function `f()`, we pass `setTimeout(()=>console.log("kiora"),0)` when call it. We therefore get 'kiora' first.

Given that the variable `promise` returns a solved promise and it is called with the keyword `await`, JavaScript will 'pause' at this line `console.log(await promise);` till the result is resolved. That is why we get "done" at the next result. 

Why we do not get "world" or "hello" at the second ? As JavaScript "pauses" at the line with `await` keyword, we cannot get "hello" as usual (note that whenever we call setTimeout(), this function will run last because it is an asynchronous task operator), whereas `setTimeout(()=> console.log("world"), 0);` should always run last.

Here we might see a bit of difference when employing `await` keyword before asynchronous operator (in this case, we use `setTimeout()` as an example) or when call the function/operator without it.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Both `countryandfruit` and `fruitandcountry` are self invoking functions. Both are declared with the keyword `async`, it means the code inside will run step by step. It helps us control the flow of data much more concise as compared to Promise-based operator or callback way.

The first function returns `"Kiora: New Zealand Kiwi"` and the second one ouputs `"Hello: New Zealand Kiwi"`. We might think that the order will be the same but actually the order of the result is reversed because the function with `await` keyword will run step by step rather than in in parallel as Promise.all. It means `fruitandcountry` will run faster than `countryandfruit`.

```
- A:  July
- B:  September
- C:  January
- D:  December

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`Object.entries` returns an array consisting of both key and value from an object while `Object.values` retuns an array of the values of object and `Object.keys` gives us an array of keys of the object. As such, `Object.entries(object)` in the code snippet above gives us a nested array with just one element in which the values are put in another nested array like that `[["month", ["July", "September", "January", "December"]]]`. 

For that reason, `Object.entries(this.object)[0][1].sort()` will actually sort the value array and return a new order as "December" -> "January" -> "July" -> "September". Hence, when we get the element with the index given by `[Object.values(this.object).length]` we get `January` because `[Object.values(this.object).length]` give us 1 (the length of the array given by Object.values);

```
- A:  NaN
- B:  12
- C:  13
- D:  14

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Comparing two arrays or two objects in JavaScript always return `false` because both are passed by reference, unlike primitive types such as string, number or boolean. That is why comparing [] and [] using either == or === returns `false`. The weird part is the `!==!!!!!` which is equivalent to `!==`, nothing special. So the `flag` is `true`.

In the expression function `f()`, we use arrow function here but and `{}` is a part of the function rather than an object. In case you want to return an object, you have to write as `let f = () => ({})` or simply using normal way to define function. With the keyword `return`, we can easily catch the content of the function when using normal way to define function.

Thus, the `typeof f()` returns `undefined` rathern `object`. We then get the length 9 and the flag (true) becomes 'true' (a string, by using toString() function), which returns 3 with the property `length`. We finally get 13.

```
- A:  4
- B:  5
- C:  6
- D:  7

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D


We have a self-invoking function with three parameters declared. Note that `arguments` inside a function returns an object consisting of the parameters of the function. 

The key part here is that when we assign a value to that array (it is array-like, as mentioned above) (or any element), the function will use that value rather than the value from the parameter we pass to it when calling the function. Hence, `c` will be `(typeof arguments).length;` (6) rather than 3.

As `c` has a new value of 6, it is definitely less than 10, so we get the final result `console.log(++c)`, which returns 7. 

Note that `arguments` is not available on arrow functions. See more detailed here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments

From ES6 onwards, it is recommended to use ...restParameter given that it is a true array. It means you can manipulate the parameter with native JavaScript functions such as map, reduce or filter.

For PHP developer, we have `func_get_args()` in PHP that does the same thing, but it will not override the value passed. Check it by yourself at https://3v4l.org/dMfhW

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

We have a class named Calculator. When declaring a new instance of the object, we pass two parameters `a` and `b`. These two parameters have the same value but `new Array(this.a).length` is totally different from `new Array(this.b).toString().length` because the latter returns a string `",,,,"` meaning the length 4 while the former returns the length of an array and we therefore get 5.

For that reason `getFlag()` returns `false`. In `getValue()` we get `typeof new Number(this.b);` which returns `object`. That is a bit different from `typeof b`, which returns `number`.

- B:  "Auckland"
- C:  "Kiwi"
- D:  "Auckland Kiwi"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The key point in this question involves the keyword `this` in JavaScript. We have a simple object that contains one method and one string property `name`. 

First, it is important to write down is that `let me = nz.callMe;` and then call `me()` is totally different from directly calling `nz.callMe()`. If we assign a variable to a method delared inside an object, `this` in that method will behave differently (when we call the variable as a method and when dirrectly call that method). In particular, in the first case, `this` is the `window` object while in the second one, `this` inside the function still points to property `name` in the object `nz`. It means `me()` returns "Auckland" while `nz.callMe` returns "Kiwi".

Then `result` will return `false` and we get the final output value `${me()} ${she()}`. Why `she()` is different from `me()`? You might easily guess that `she` still `bind` to the object `nz` rather than `window` object as in `me()`.

#### Answer: D

The code snippet above is not a big challenge for you I guess. It simply gives you an example of `this` in different contexts when we declare an anonymous function inside a method of an object. The three first methods are common ways to handle `this` using `this` as second parameter in `map()`, by using `bind(this)` in `forEach` (or map()) or by `that = this`technique (we did use `seft` rathern `that`).

The last method `Me()` will cause unexpected result because `this.name` does not bind to the object `club`. Note that you might get another result when testing the code on jsbin.com. On Chrome and Firefox, we get 0.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`...` can be used in two ways in JavaScript (and PHP) as either `spread operator` or `rest parameter`. You might have to check the following article about the two. They are the same as three dots, but the way they are employed vary considerably between the two. https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread-operator

We see both `spread operator` and `rest parameter` in the code snippet above. First the parameter `(...a)` in the self-invoking function is of course a `rest parameter` while the constant `c` we see the `spread operator`. In the former case, it simply means that you can pass to the function as many parameter as you want. Note that the `typeof a` in this case is `object` even though it is a native array in JavaScript. (I means native array because you might think about array-like if we use arguments. Please have a look at the question 28 or this link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).

`Spread operator` as in the constant `c` allows us to combine array. So `...a` in the code above is `rest parameter` when it is used as function parameter but in this case it is the syntax of `spread operator`.


Finally, we get `c` with 5 elements but the first element has 10 child elements (when we pass to the function `new Array(10)`). The length of both then returns 15.

```
- A:  "Vuong"
- B:  undefined
- C:  ErrorReference
- D:  false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We have a function constructor `Kiora` (written with a capital letter, but that is optional) that can be used to create object, as the `student` object in the code above. In the function, we have two parameters with the second one is actually a `rest parameter`. The typeof operator is `object` but if we check with `Array.isArray(array)` it also returns true.

For that reason, `Array.isArray(career) === true && typeof career === "object"` returns true. Hence the `return` operator finally returns an object `{}`.

You might be surprised when `console.log(student.name);` outputs `undefined` given that the constructor function `Kiora` returns an object. Otherwise, we might simply get the value `name`.

#### Answer: D

Apologize that the code snippet is a bit longer than usual. But actually it is not really challenging as you might think. You can easily get the correct result after spending a little of time to debug.

First we declare a class that has two methods. The first method `filter()` will returns the first element of the array (of the propterty `element`) or simply returns `hello` depending on the `type()` method. We know that `typeof of array` will return `object` so the `filter()` method return `this.element[0].name`.

Try to make you feel confused, we then call the built-in `filter()` method. This native method returns a new array depending on the condition we pass to the call-back function. Note that `!item.isdeveloped` means `false`. It means we get `Vietnam`.

Finally we get `New Zealand`.length and `Vietnam`.length, which in total returns 18.
